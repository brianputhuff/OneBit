OneBit

This program accepts, as input, a .BMP image file and exports a Black and White .BMP image. The program renders output as black and white pixels only and uses dithering to simulate shades. There is no gray scale.

The program also generates an ASCII variant of the dithered image as a text file.

This program uses the EasyBMP Cross-Platform Windows Bitmap Library (http://easybmp.sourceforge.net/). You will need this to compile
